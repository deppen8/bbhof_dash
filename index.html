<h2>Notes on the tracker</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can isolate a player in both plots by clicking on their bar in the top plot. To select multiple players, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while clicking.</li>
  <li>The thin red line in both plots represents 75% of the ballots recorded so far.</li>
  <li>The bronze line in the top plot represents the estimated 309 votes that will be necessary for induction.</li>
  <li>The data has to be manually updated. I will try to update daily. The x-axis on the bottom plot will show you how current the data is.</li>
  <li>Obviously, as more votes come in, the tracker should become more interesting, so bookmark it and check back often.</li>
</ul>
