Ryan Thibodaux ([@NotMrTibbs](https://twitter.com/NotMrTibbs)) and his team have done the amazing work of compiling publicly available ballots for the Baseball Hall of Fame. You can (and should) see the data at [bit.ly/hall19](https://bit.ly/hall19). It includes much more data than I have incorporated here.

As a fan of that project for a few years now, I thought I might be able to contribute by adding a couple of visualizations that I think help supplement their awesome dataset. All great data deserves great dataviz.

# Who am I?
I am currently a PhD student in archaeology at the University of Washington who happens to love both baseball and data visualizations. You can read more about me on my [academic page](https://deppen8.github.io/), see more code at [github.com/deppen8](https://github.com/deppen8), or follow me [@jacob_deppen](https://twitter.com/jacob_deppen) on Twitter if you are into that.
