<h2>Notes on the tracker</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The visualization above shows all <em>public</em> ballots for 2018. The red line represents 75% of these ballots. If a player is past the line, it means that they would have been inducted without private ballots.</li>
  <li>The dotted gray line in the bottom plot shows a running 75% benchmark.</li>
  <li>You can isolate a player in both plots by clicking on their bar in the top plot. To select multiple players, hold <b>Shift</b> while clicking.</li>
  <li>You can now zoom in to the bottom plot.</li>
</ul>
